Homework for SFSD Module

Repository Overview

This repository contains solutions for two tasks assigned as part of the Software Fundamentals and System Design (SFSD) module. Below is an overview of each task:

Task 1: Binary Tree Sibling Finder

Description

This task involves implementing a program to find the sibling of a given node in a binary tree. The task makes use of:

A structure (Node) to represent each node in the tree.

A recursive function findSibling to determine the sibling of a target node.

Features

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Utilizes malloc to create new nodes dynamically.

Recursive Traversal: Explores the binary tree recursively to locate the sibling of the specified node.

Usage

Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).

Provide a binary tree structure and a target node to find its sibling.

Task 2: Number Inversion

Description

This task provides two implementations for inverting an integer number:

Procedural Method: Iterative approach to reverse the digits of a number.

Recursive Method: Recursive approach to achieve the same.

Features

Allows the user to choose between procedural and recursive methods for inversion.

Interactive input for numbers.

Usage

Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).

Run the program and follow the prompts to:

Choose the inversion method.

Enter the number to be inverted.

The program outputs the inverted number.
